# RNN-Based Text Classification

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify news articles into various categories using text data. Leveraging Keras with TensorFlow as the backend, the model processes and classifies text into predefined categories based on the article's content.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of news articles labeled into distinct categories. It contains:
- **text**: The content of the news article.
- **labels**: The category of the article (e.g., "business", "sport").

### Dataset Structure
The dataset comprises 2,225 entries and two columns:
| Column | Description                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `text` | Text content of the news article  |
| `labels` | Category label of the article   |

## Project Structure
The core components of this project are organized as follows:
- `bbc_text_cls.csv` - Dataset file with text articles and labels.
- `RNN_for_Text_Classification.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook implementing the RNN model for text classification.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and several dependencies. Install them with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Notebook**: Open `RNN_for_Text_Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. **Run the Cells Sequentially**: Execute each cell to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: The notebook includes sections for testing and evaluating model performance.

### Running the Model
The notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough. Here's a summary of the main steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize and pad text sequences for uniform input.
- **Model Training**: Define the RNN architecture, compile the model, and train on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate performance on the test set to gauge classification accuracy.

## Model Architecture
The model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the following layers:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **RNN Layer**: Uses LSTM, GRU, or SimpleRNN for sequence processing.
- **Global Max Pooling**: Reduces dimensionality by taking the max value in each feature map.
- **Dense Output Layer**: Maps to the number of classes for classification.

### Hyperparameters
- **Vocabulary Size**: 2000
- **Sequence Length**: Set dynamically based on input padding
- **Embedding Dimension**: Customizable based on experimentation
- **RNN Units**: Configurable for LSTM, GRU, or SimpleRNN

## Results
After training, the model achieves the following performance:
- **Training Accuracy**: Varies based on parameters
- **Test Accuracy**: Depends on the model architecture and hyperparameters used

Performance results can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, such as the number of units in the RNN layer, embedding dimension, and sequence length.
